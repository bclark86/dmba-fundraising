## TL;DR

The Situation-Complication-Resolution (SCR) Framework

Now, letâ€™s define each component of SCR:

  - Situation: The framing of the important, recent context the audience
    already knows and accepts as fact.
  - Complication: The reason the situation requires action.
  - Resolution: The action required to solve a problem (or capture an
    opportunity).
